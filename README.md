# Dataset Creator (for the Rutgers Bee Project)

A comprehensive data processing and analysis project focusing on time-stamped log data.

## Introduction

This project involves processing and analyzing time-stamped log data stored in various text files. The data is used to generate insights and visualizations. The primary purpose is to handle log files efficiently, perform necessary transformations, and enable seamless data analysis.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Preprocess Data**: Run the [Make_Dataset.py](Make_Dataset.py) script to preprocess the log files and generate the dataset.

```bash
python Make_Dataset.py
```

2. **Analysis**: Use the processed dataset (and example in [dataset.csv](dataset.csv)) for further analysis and visualization as needed.
